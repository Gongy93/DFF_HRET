1. Dataset in the subfolder ./data/

     (a) HRET_v8.1_compressed.nc:
	 A global satellite data of baroclinic sea surface height(SSH) induced by M2 internal tides:
	 Four key harmonics are included, namely M2, S2, O1 and K1.
   	 The data is a satellite altimetry product (HRET) provided by Zaron (2019).
	 It can be downloaded freely from the internet (http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~zaron/pub/HRET.html).
			
     (b) Bathy_HRET.nc:
	 Bathymetry data using GEBCO_08, which has been interpolated to fit the cells in the HRET product
	        	   
===================================================================================

2. Scripts and functions

     (a) Extract_HRET:
         Use the given bounds of longitude and latitude to select the interest region. 	 
	   
     (b) DFF_HRET:
         Take the directional Fourier filter (DFF) method to get the wave signal propagating in a certain direction
         (Mercier et al., 2008; Gong et al. 2020).

3. Examples in the subfolder ./example/
    
     (a) Australian Northwest Shelf: 
         M2 internal tides propagating in the direction with the angle ranging from 90 deg to 200 deg.
	 
     (b) Northern South China Sea: 
         M2 internal tides propagating westward.
